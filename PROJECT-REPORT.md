# Project Completion Report — Vehicle Selector Pro

**Date:** 2026-08-30
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Production deployed and verified

---

## Executive summary

Vehicle Selector Pro is a production-grade Shopify application for automotive, powersports, and specialty-parts merchants. The app solves the Year-Make-Model-Trim-Engine (YMMTE) fitment problem — customers find the right parts through cascading storefront filters and see Guaranteed Exact Fit badges on product pages.

The application is **live on Fly.io**, **installed on a real Shopify development store**, and **fully documented** with a clean GitHub homepage, professional screenshots, and an AI-narrated demo video.

## Technical architecture

```
Storefront (Theme App Extension)
  → Shopify App Proxy (HMAC-SHA256 signed)
    → Rails 7.1 (VehicleFiltersController)
      → PostgreSQL (normalized YMMTE cache)
      → Redis (cascading tree cache, 180s TTL)
      → Sidekiq (metafield sync, webhook processing)
        → Shopify GraphQL Admin API (metafieldsSet)
```

### Key design decisions

1. **No ScriptTag** — 100% Theme App Extension (OS 2.0 compliant)
2. **Server-side filtering** — not client-side JS; sub-15ms from cache
3. **Persistent My Garage** — localStorage across pages and sessions
4. **HMAC on every request** — constant-time comparison, no bypass
5. **Multi-tenant by design** — explicit `shop_id` scoping on every query

## AI-generated demo pipeline

The demo video was created using an automated pipeline:

1. **Playwright** recorded a real screen video of the automated walkthrough in `demo/index.html` (virtual cursor, timed cues driving actual page interactions)
2. **ElevenLabs TTS** generated 13 narration clips, one per walkthrough cue
3. **ffmpeg** mixed the cue-synced narration over a subtle music bed, applied loudness normalization, and encoded H.264 + AAC with faststart

Scripts:
- `demo/autoplay/record_v3.js` — Playwright screen recording of the walkthrough
- `demo/autoplay/build_v3.sh` — ffmpeg audio mixing (per-cue delays, music bed, loudnorm) and assembly
- `demo/autoplay/audio_v3/` — narration clips + music bed
- `demo/index.html` — the scripted walkthrough page that was recorded

| Integration tests | 9 runs, 28 assertions, 0 failures |
| Metafield read-back | 7/7 products carry `custom.vehicle_fitment` |
| OAuth flow | Real install on `vehicle-selector-pro.myshopify.com` |
| Demo video | 156s MP4, real screen recording, narrated, 7.5 MB |
| GitHub homepage | Screenshots, features, quick start, docs links |
| All 11 client requirements | Verified in `REQUIREMENTS-VERIFICATION.md` |

## Known limitations

- Native Shopify collection filtering (`filter.v.m.*`) does not apply to JSON metafields; the widget's primary filtering path is App Proxy search
- `/storefront_preview` is a development-only route for demonstrating the extension outside a theme
- Theme blocks must be added to the merchant's theme in the theme editor (app scopes intentionally exclude `write_themes`)
- ACES/PIES and VIN decoding are out of scope for this build
