## 🌟 Executive Summary

Vehicle Selector Pro is an enterprise-grade Shopify application engineered to solve the complex automotive Year-Make-Model-Trim-Engine (YMMTE) fitment problem for merchants.

By combining a **normalized, high-speed multi-tenant local cache** with **Shopify Product Metafield synchronization** (`custom.vehicle_fitment` metafields via GraphQL `metafieldsSet`), Vehicle Selector Pro delivers cached storefront filtering, guaranteed fitment badges on product detail pages (PDP), and customer vehicle wallets ("My Garage") without impacting store performance or using deprecated ScriptTag APIs.

## 📦 Key Deliverables Included

1. **Source Code & Git Repository**:
   - Complete Rails 7.1 application with ActiveRecord multi-tenant models, controllers, background workers, and service objects.
   - Shopify Theme App Extension with Liquid blocks (`blocks/vehicle_selector_filter.liquid`, `blocks/product_fitment_badge.liquid`) and vanilla JavaScript client (`assets/vehicle-selector.js`).
   - Two automated test suites: isolated unit harness (11 runs / 35 assertions) and full-stack integration tests that boot the real app and issue HTTP requests (9 runs / 28 assertions) — all passing.

2. **Live Deployment & Verification**:
   - **Live link to submit:** **https://vehicle-selector-pro.fly.dev** — health `https://vehicle-selector-pro.fly.dev/up` → `{"status":"ok"}` (Fly: `iad`, Puma + Sidekiq + Postgres + private Redis `vsp-redis`)
   - **Install:** `https://vehicle-selector-pro.fly.dev/login?shop=vehicle-selector-pro.myshopify.com` (OAuth `shopify_app` 22.0, tokens encrypted)
   - The public demo currently contains 34 mapped products, 48 YMMTE configurations and 169 fitments. These demo pages require no Shopify login and are read-only.
   - To install the actual app for a merchant, use the Shopify OAuth URL `https://vehicle-selector-pro.fly.dev/login?shop=your-store.myshopify.com` after configuring the merchant's store domain and approving the requested scopes.
   - Full evidence trail in [`REQUIREMENTS-VERIFICATION.md`](REQUIREMENTS-VERIFICATION.md).

3. **Demo Assets — what to submit:**
   - **Inline GitHub walkthroughs:** the two narrated videos play directly on the repository homepage from GitHub attachment assets; the [video gallery](https://muhib-karim.github.io/vehicle-selector-pro/demo/videos.html) is the fullscreen alternative.
   - **Recorded MP4 fallback:** [`demo/Vehicle_Selector_Pro_Demo_v3.mp4`](demo/Vehicle_Selector_Pro_Demo_v3.mp4) + script [`docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md).
   - `/demo` and `/demo/admin` are the current public live previews. `/storefront_preview` and `admin_preview` are development-only legacy routes for local re-recording.

4. **Production Documentation**:
   - Clean [`README.md`](README.md) — features, quick start, tech stack, links to all docs
   - [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) — local development guide
   - [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — verified Fly.io runbook incl. real incident table
   - [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) — App Proxy endpoints, webhook topics, metafield schema
   - [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — system diagrams, data model, request flow

## Client Demonstration Script & Presentation Guide (2–3 Minutes)

Use the professional voiceover script in [`docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) when presenting the solution to stakeholders or clients. The script includes:

- **Scene-by-scene narration** with timestamps and screen directions
- **Continuous read version** for single-take recording
- **Recording setup** recommendations (OBS Studio + mic, or Loom)

The narrated walkthroughs play inline on the [GitHub repository homepage](https://github.com/muhib-karim/vehicle-selector-pro#demo). For fullscreen playback, use the [GitHub Pages video gallery](https://muhib-karim.github.io/vehicle-selector-pro/demo/videos.html). The original MP4 remains available at [`demo/Vehicle_Selector_Pro_Demo_v3.mp4`](demo/Vehicle_Selector_Pro_Demo_v3.mp4).

## 🏛️ Technical Specifications Summary

- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails 7.1 (Ruby >= 3.2.0)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite3 (Development & CI)
- **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq 7 + Redis with exponential backoff for GraphQL rate-limiting
- **Shopify API Version**: `2025-07` (GraphQL Admin API); fitment values are written to the `custom.vehicle_fitment` product metafield via GraphQL `metafieldsSet`. Because the Admin API cannot create merchant-owned `custom`-namespace metafield **definitions**, the merchant creates that one definition in the Shopify admin (Product → Metafields) with *Public read* storefront access; the app handles every value write automatically.
- **App Proxy Security**: HMAC-SHA256 verification via constant-time comparison (`ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare`)
- **Theme Extension**: Zero ScriptTag API usage; 100% Theme App Extension (OS 2.0) compliant.
