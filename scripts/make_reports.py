TITLE = "Vehicle Selector Pro"
SUBTITLE = "A Production-Grade Shopify App for Vehicle Fitment"
DATE_LINE = "Project Report  /  August 2026"

FREE_AI_STATEMENT = (
    "Built with free AI tools. This project was designed, coded, and documented using no-cost AI "
    "assistance end to end — no paid AI models, APIs, or commercial tooling were used anywhere in "
    "its development. Everything visible here was produced with accessible, free tooling. That is "
    "deliberate: it demonstrates the ceiling of what free tooling already achieves, and it means "
    "the potential for further growth is massive — with paid, frontier AI models and paid "
    "tooling, this same foundation scales into an even richer, production-grade, store-ready "
    "solution with ease."
)

RESOURCE_STATEMENT = (
    "Built at the ceiling of a consumer notebook. This entire project — the Rails application, the "
    "Shopify integration, the storefront, every diagram, this report, and even the two narrated "
    "walkthrough videos — was designed, coded, tested, and rendered on a single "
    "ASUS ZenBook "
    "UX433FA: a 2018-vintage, netbook-class consumer laptop. An Intel Core i7-8565U at 1.80 GHz "
    "(4 cores, ~15 W), 16 GB RAM, and only Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics. No GPU. No "
    "dedicated developer workstation. No cloud IDE. It is not a developer machine — it is the kind "
    "of everyday notebook you buy for browsing and documents — and every frame of video and every "
    "page of this report was produced on the CPU of that one machine. That constraint is deliberate "
    "and it is the strongest evidence of the opportunity: so far the ceiling was set by the "
    "hardware, not by the ambition. Put this same foundation on a proper development workstation "
    "with a GPU and paid, frontier AI models, and the architecture scales into a far richer, "
    "faster, store-ready solution. The headroom — and the case for investing in proper developer "
    "tools — is the opportunity."
)

HARDWARE_SPECS = [
    ("Device", "ASUS ZenBook UX433FA"),
    ("Class", "Netbook-class consumer laptop — not a developer machine"),
    ("CPU", "Intel Core i7-8565U @ 1.80 GHz (4 cores, ~15 W)"),
    ("Memory", "16 GB RAM"),
    ("Graphics", "Intel UHD 620 — integrated only, no GPU"),
    ("Origin", "2018-vintage consumer notebook"),
]

CLOSING = (
    "The application is live, deployed, and healthy. Both the storefront shopping experience and "
    "the merchant command center are fully functional and can be explored immediately, and the two "
    "narrated walkthrough videos — merchant and shopper — "
    "demonstrate the complete flow from setup to purchase. Vehicle "
    "Selector Pro is ready for further development, App Store submission, or customization to a "
    "specific merchant catalog — and because it was built entirely with free AI tooling, the "
    "ceiling on that next stage is exceptionally high."
)

INTRO = (
    "Vehicle Selector Pro is a complete Ruby on Rails application that lets Shopify merchants "
    "map vehicle attributes (Year, Make, Model, Trim, Engine) to their products and gives "
    "customers a dynamic, cascading fitment widget on the storefront. It ships as a "
    "production-grade Rails app with a normalized local data cache, Shopify Metafield sync, a "
    "Theme App Extension widget, App Proxy endpoints, GraphQL data integration, and asynchronous "
    "processing via ActiveJob and Sidekiq — engineered from the start for the Shopify App Store."
)

PROBLEM = (
    "Selling aftermarket parts is uniquely hard online. A brake pad or a wiper blade is not "
    "universally compatible: it depends on the exact Year, Make, Model, Trim and Engine (YMMTE) "
    "of the customer's vehicle. Getting this wrong means wrong parts, angry customers, and "
    "expensive returns. Merchants who can't afford a commercial fitment database either stop "
    "listing the data, drown shoppers in dense compatibility tables, or hard-code rules into "
    "individual product pages where they quickly rot and cost hours to maintain."
)

SOLUTION_AND_WHY = (
    "Vehicle Selector Pro turns fitment from a per-product chore into a single, structured, "
    "reusable dataset. Fitments are entered once, stored in a normalized multi-tenant cache, and "
    "pushed to Shopify metafields — so the storefront, the product pages, and the merchant admin "
    "all stay in sync without ongoing per-part fees or brittle scripts."
)

PILLARS = [
    ("Normalized local cache",
     "Fitments live in structured ActiveRecord tables (48 YMMTE configurations, 402 verified "
     "fitments, 74 products, 25 brands in the demo), so filtering is instant and never pounds "
     "Shopify's API."),
    ("Shopify Metafield sync",
     "Fitment data is written to the custom.vehicle_fitment product metafield via the GraphQL "
     "metafieldsSet mutation, batched to stay inside API limits, so product pages render their "
     "own fitment badge."),
    ("Cascading storefront widget",
     "Year → Make → Model → Trim → Engine menus narrow the catalog behind an HMAC-signed App "
     "Proxy, returning only parts that fit the selected vehicle."),
    ("Async, resilient background jobs",
     "Webhooks and syncs run on Sidekiq + Redis with exponential backoff and per-topic policies, "
     "so a traffic spike never blocks the request path."),
]

FEATURES = [
    ("Cascading storefront widget",
     "Year, Make, Model, Trim, Engine dropdowns driven by HMAC-SHA256-signed App Proxy queries. "
     "Each selection returns only the options that actually exist, progressively narrowing the "
     "catalog until the customer reaches parts that fit their vehicle.",
     "Cascading dropdowns over HMAC-signed App Proxy data"),
    ("Product fitment badges",
     "Every product dynamically renders a Guaranteed Exact Fit / Does NOT Fit / Universal Fit "

     "A Polaris-styled command center: fitment matrix, vehicle library, bulk CSV import, sync "
     "monitor, and widget settings — all read from the normalized local database for fast, "
     "debuggable queries instead of live Shopify round-trips.",
     "Manage every fitment from one place"),
    ("Metafield sync",
     "Fitment JSON is written to custom.vehicle_fitment via GraphQL metafieldsSet in batches of "
     "25, with a per-shop sync log and progress tracking so merchants see exactly what synced and "
     "what failed.",
     "Reliable, observable writes to Shopify"),
    ("Webhook pipeline",
     "products/*, app/uninstalled and shop/update events are HMAC-verified, then dispatched to "
     "Sidekiq jobs that keep the cache and tenant state correct — including graceful cleanup on "
     "uninstall and full GDPR data-erasure handlers.",
     "Shopify events processed asynchronously and securely"),
    ("Multi-tenant isolation",
     "Every query is scoped to the authenticated shop; OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest; and "
     "App Proxy / webhook traffic is verified with constant-time HMAC comparison.",
     "Per-shop isolation and encrypted tokens"),

    "App Extension widget, which talks to the Rails application over signed App Proxy endpoints. "

    "endpoints, all backed by a normalized PostgreSQL cache. Background Sidekiq jobs perform "

WORKFLOWS = [

     "Polaris dashboard — all through the standard shopify_app 22 flow."),
    ("Fitment selection",
     "A shopper picks Year → Make → Model → Trim → Engine. Each request hits an App Proxy endpoint "
     "that verifies the HMAC signature, then queries the local cache to return only matching options."),

     "When fitments are saved, a BatchSyncJob builds a compact JSON payload per product and writes "
     "it via metafieldsSet in batches of 25, updating the sync log as it goes."),
    ("Webhook handling",
